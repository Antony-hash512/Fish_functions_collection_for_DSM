# Fish Functions for NAS

A collection of useful functions for the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/).
Primarily developed and tested on **Synology DSM**, but some scripts (like NUT wrappers) may work on other Linux distributions.

## Dependencies
Some functions rely on specific tools:
- **Synology DSM**: `synoacltool` (for permission scripts)
- **NUT**: `upsc` (for UPS status checks)

## Status
🚧 **Work in Progress.**
A more detailed README with installation instructions and examples (similar to [my other repo](https://github.com/Antony-hash512/Fish_functions_collection/blob/master/README.md)) is coming soon.
